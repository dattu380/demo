                                                                                                                                  Docker
*--->   docker is  software platform that simplifies the process of builinding , running , and distributing applications
*--->   docker is a compiter program that performs operating system level virtualization , also knowas "containerization"
            docker is used to run software packages called "containers"


docker follows client-server architecture , which includes the three main componetys that are docker client, docker host , docker registroy

                                                                                    docker architucuture

docker client
---------------------
docker client uses commands and RESTAPI to communicate with docker daemon(server)
   
   docker build
   docker pull
   docker run
 
note: docker client has an ability to communicate with more than one docker deamon


docker host
------------------

docker host is used to provied an environment to excute and run applications. it containers the docker deamon , images , container ,network ,and  stroage.


docker registry
----------------------
docker registry manges and stroy the docker images
-- there are two types registries in the docker

---public registry: public registry is also called as docker hub.com
--- private registry: it is used to share images within the enterprise.

docker deamon:
------------------- 
this is brogund priocess ehich takes the commands fired by docker client and sends them to the docker imagess or containers or docker regisrty




MAIN CONTENTES OF DOCKER
-------------------------------------------
1)  DCKERIMAGES
2)  DOCKER CONTAINER
3)DOCKER FILE
4)DOCKER VOLUMES
5) DOCKER BIND MOUNT
6)DOCKER NETWORK
7) DOCKER COMPOSE
8) DOCKER SWAM




DOCKERIMAGES
----------------------
an image is a collection of bin/lib that are necessry for an applications to run. all the docker images are present in the cloud site of docker called hub.docker.com


DOCKER CONTAINER
-------------------------------
 Docker is tool desinged to make it easier to create,deploy, and run application by using containers.
Containers allow adeveloper to package up an application with alla of the parts it needs . such as libratries and other dependces , and  deploy it has one package
Each container gets its own isolated user spaces to allows multiple containers to run on a single host machine.



DOCKER FILE
--------------------
INSTRUCTIONS : the instructions are not case-senstive but you must follow conventions which is recommanded to use upper case
---------------------
FROM   
------------
the frist instruction must be from in order to specify thebase image
 this instruction is used to set the base image for thr subsequent instructions
from ubuntu

LABEL
use LABEL instruction to set label for the image
we can add labels an images to oranize images of our project
LABEL vendor/="/tpoint"

RUN
this instruction is used to execute any command of the current image
RUN/bin/bash-c 'source $ HOME/bashrc, 'echo$HOME'

CMD
this is used to execute appliction by the image
there can be only one cmd in a docker file
ifwe use more than one cmd only last one will execute.
cmd ["executable" , "pareml" , "paramz"]

COPY
thia is instruction is used to copy new file or directory from source to the file system of the container at the destination
 copy abc/xyz

WORKDIR
the workdir is used to set the wroking directory for any RUN , CMD COPY instruction that follows it in the dockerfile does not exitx it will be created by default


sample docker file
--------------------------                                                                             
MAINTAINER  " dattu"
RUN apt-get update-y
RUN apt-get install apache2
ADD . /var/www/html
ENTRYPOINT apachectl -D FOREGROUND
ENV name devops   

sample docker file
--------------------------                                                                             

FROM ubuntu:16.04
MAINTAINER  " dattu"
RUN apt-get update-y
RUN apt-get install apache2
RUN apt-get instal -y git 
RUN cd/var/www/html && /
           git clone copy the url
COPY  testfiles.txt /var/www/html/
ENTRYPOINT apachectl -D FOREGROUND



DOCKER VOLUMES
----------------------------
In oreder to be able to save(presist) data and also to share data between container , docker come up with the concept of volumes
volumes are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is manged by docker (var/lib/docker/volumes/on linux)
bind mount may be stroed anywhere on the host system
